# # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# # followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# # build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# # Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# # In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# # Read more about iOS versioning at

# # In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# # of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# # Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# # To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# # consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# # dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# # the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# # versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.
# dependencies:
#   flutter:
#     sdk: flutter
#   firebase_core: ^2.10.0
#   firebase_auth: ^4.6.2
#   cloud_firestore: ^4.8.4

#   # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
#   # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is

#   # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
#   # rules and activating additional ones.

#   # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
#   # assets:
#   #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#   #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

#   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
#   # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

#   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
#   # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

#   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
#   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#   # example:
#   # fonts:
#   #   - family: Schyler
#   #     fonts:
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#   #         style: italic
#   #   - family: Trajan Pro
#   #     fonts:
#   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
